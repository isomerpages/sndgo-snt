The BBC microbit is a pocket-sized computer 
designed to inspire every child to create their 
best digital future. It is a multi-functional tool 
that works in lots of different ways when 
programmed to do so. Through the microbit, 
children are encouraged to explore their ideas 
while using real code and real computational 
thinking, and it makes coding fun. 

Participants will get an introduction to BBC 
Microbit device, learn about Block coding in 
Microsoft MakeCode and use LED display 
output to show words, numbers and pictures.
