**Date**: 9 October, Saturday<br>
**Time**: 10am - 12pm  
**Conducted by**: Kodecoon  

This workshop exposes your child to the world of 
programming through their first game/animation on 
Scratch, and brings their imagination to life. Through this 
introductory class, your child will step into the world of
 programming and take on the role of a creator, not just
game players. First Line of Code will gauge your child's 
level of interest in coding and assess their logical thinking 
process.

As this programme is conducted at various levels, your 
child will be encouraged to first complete a short, online 
quiz on their interest, logical thinking process and
 readiness, in order to assess which workshop he or she 
is best suited to. This allows the students to get the most 
out of the workshop and start their programming journey!
