CodeMonkey curriculum offers a friendly but challenging introduction to computer programming, with a bit more rigor and knowledge transfer that can be found in the elementary coding tools. The easy-to-read code and easy-to-follow connection between the code and the action make it a perfect platform for talking about some core concepts in programming. Students will enjoy the challenging puzzles and the cartoon setting.

Young learners will:
*  Learn coding in real programming language “CoffeeScript” as they help a monkey catch bananas
*  Introduce and better understand coding concepts such as “turn” using degrees, “step” backwards, etc
*  Attempt to complete and solve  challenges 0-15 (up to 30 challenges)
