This workshop is an introduction to computer programming suitable for students aged 11 and above. We will be using the popular Python 3 programming language as the course medium. Over the course of the workshop, participants will be guided through a few program examples (such as Tic Tac Toe activity!) to illustrate Pythonâ€™s computational thinking skillset of decomposing, abstraction, pattern recognition and algorithm.
