#### COURSE OBJECTIVES
Through a series of fun and engaging hands-on activities, this Professional Certificate aims to empower individuals who are new to data analysis and coding by equipping the learner with two things: (1) the foundational concepts and skills to carry out basic data analysis on Microsoft Excel and create simple but powerful algorithms to solve complex real-world problems; and (2) the critical reasoning skills essential to using these computational tools effectively and well so that they can critically self-evaluate the way they apply these tools, and thus be able to reason effectively in a variety of contexts. 

Learners will learn to identify problems and design solutions, while also developing a critical awareness of the merits and limits of their methods, thereby empowering them to make better-informed decisions and to articulate strong justifications for those decisions.

#### WHO SHOULD ATTEND
This course is best suited for professionals, executives, managers, as well as fresh graduates from non-technical backgrounds wishing to pick up the foundational skills in coding and data analysis to further their careers.

If you’ve taken computing courses before and struggled to learn, this course is for you! We have designed this with the assumption that you have no familiarity in data analysis and coding, and we’ll teach you all you need to know from the ground up in a fun and engaging manner.
