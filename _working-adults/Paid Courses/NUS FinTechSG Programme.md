#### **OVERVIEW**

The NUS FinTech SG Programme is a Professional Certificate in FinTech designed to enhance the competitiveness of the Singapore FinTech Industry. The program is jointly developed by National University Singapore (NUS) School of Computing (SoC) and AI Singapore, in consultation with experts in innovation and FinTech from UBS Bank, RIPPLE, World Economic Forum, and Bank of New York Mellon.

We've made the course to be very hands-on and ideally, someone with a full-time job can work with their employer to:

1. Take 2 weeks at the beginning of the course for the immersion portion. This is critical to learn "WHY" Fintech and connect into the FinTech ecosystem.
2. Take 2 or 3 days per week for class (perhaps adjust work hours)
3. Discuss how you can apply your learning to your work

The programme will be fully funded for NUS students graduating in 2021 (for eligible students).
