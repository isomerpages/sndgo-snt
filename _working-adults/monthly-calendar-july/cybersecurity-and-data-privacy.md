Have you used WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger or even SafeEntry? If you have, your data is made digitally secure. But what is cybersecurity actually about and why should I care?
 
In this talk, speakers DAC Aileen Yap (Assistant Director, Anti-Scam Division at SPF) and Mr Raju Chellam (Chief Editor of the AI Ethics & Governance Body of Knowledge) tackle the basics of cybersecurity and the impact of cyber crime on users. They will also share ways on how users can protect their data better and what to do if they fall victim to a cyberattack amid the increase in online scams during the COVID-19 pandemic.
