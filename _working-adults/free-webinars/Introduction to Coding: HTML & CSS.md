Data analytics plays a crucial role in the development of a Smart Nation, whether it’s to help make a city carbon neutral, promote green modes of transportation, or manage our infrastructure. Yet the rapid rate that data is generated also means we need to make sense of the information, and ease the decision-making process.

In this webinar, participants will gain insights on:
1. The practices of using data analytics today, looking at both tool-based and programming-based approaches
2. The pathway for the future of data analytics and organisations’ adoption strategies
