## Children, Youths & Young Parents
Parents can sign their children up for the **TECH@PLAY** or **FUN WITH TECH** interactive, hands-on workshop series. Children will have the opportunity to learn skills such as coding, 3D printing and artificial intelligence.

Curated specially for youths, we have **TECH UPSIZED**. These workshops provide participants with an opportunity to take a dive into the latest tech matters. They can also share their ideas with other tech-enthusiast youths!
